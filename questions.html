    <h2>What Questions</h2>
    <p>
      Every server has rules, although our rules are a bit more
      straight forward than usual. This section tests your knowledge
      of our rules.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>If we can't make a list of questions about our rules
      then we can put the actual ruleset in here</em></li>
      <li><em>This should be a "sanity" check, to see
      if applicants are paying attention to the questions at all.</em></li>
      <li><em>Consider this a basic filter</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Questions</h2>
    <p>
      Our server runs on a case by case basis, so naturally,
      instead of testing you on the rules of the land, it'd be
      more appropriate to test you on your ability to react.
      <br />
      Following are scenarios, where <strong>multiple answers
      are correct.</strong> Choose the awnser that you feel is
      most important: the action you'd perform first.
      <br />
      It doesn't matter <em>what</em> your awnser to this question is.
      What matters in this case is <em>why</em> you
      choose the awnser.
    </p>
    <h3>Scenarios</h3>
    <ul id="scenarios">
      <li>
        You find your base raided: All of your stuff is missing, chests are empty.
        What would be your first action?
        <ul>
          <li>Try to find who stole the goods, and try to get it back</li>
          <li>Go to the moderators, report what happened.</li>
          <li>Ignore it all, and try to gather resources to recover</li>
          <li>Question yourself... has your base really been raided?</li>
          <li>Other...</li>
        </ul>
        Why would you choose this action?
        <br />

      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Someone is breaking Rule #1 and well... being a dick. They'are
        angry about (having their base raided/being harrassed by another
        member/their family treating them unfairly/griefers destroying
        their base), and are swearing, insulting people, and generally
        making chat a negative enviornment.
        What is your first action?
        <ul>
          <li>Attempt to defuse the situation, listening</li>
          <li>Go to the moderators, report what happened.</li>
          <li>Ignore them with /ignore, and continue playing your game</li>
          <li>See if there is some way distract them from their issue</li>
          <li>Other...</li>
        </ul>
        If you were a moderator, what would you choose instead? Why?
        <br />
        <input type="text" name="" placeholder="Enter response here">
      </li>
      <br />

          (questions for those over the age of 18... or those mature enough)
        </p>
        One of your friends is upset. Someone has been harrassing them,
        asking for innapropriate pictures, constantly private messaging
        them about sexual topics without their consent.
        (<em>THEIR NAME IS FUCKING GIO</em>)
        Your friend is visibly uncomfortable, what would be your first
        action?
        <ul>
          <li>Try to listen to both sides, see what the other person has to say</li>
          <li>Go to the moderators, and report what happened.</li>
          <li>Try to cheer up your friend, diverting their attention to something else</li>
          <li>Listen to your friend, and reccommend some advice</li>
          <li>Other...</li>
        </ul>
        If this situation is happening to you, what would you choose instead?
        <br />
        <input type="text" name=""  placeholder="Enter response here">
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>More scenarios to come...</p>
  <p>
    <em>
      These scenarios should test the applicant's critical thinking.
      It'd be interesting to see how new players respond to events
      that happened on the server.
      <br />
      New Scenarios are always welcome! If you have any ideas or
      possible scenarios to ask new players, send a ping to a
      developer or post to #feedback on Discord.
